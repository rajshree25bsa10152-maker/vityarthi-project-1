Project to calculate percentile through rank 
# Rank-to-Percentile Calculator

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a [Python/C++/Java] application designed to calculate a student's **Percentile** based on their obtained **Rank** and the **Total Number of Candidates** who appeared for the examination. This tool helps students estimate their relative standing in competitive exams.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The application takes two primary inputs:
1. **Rank:** The student's position in the merit list.
2. **Total Candidates:** The total number of students who took the exam.

It applies the standard statistical formula to generate a percentile score up to [2] decimal places.

## 🧮 The Formula
The project uses the inverse rank calculation method:

$$Percentile = \left( \frac{N - R}{N} \right) \times 100$$

Where:
* $N$ = Total Number of Candidates
* $R$ = Rank Secured

## 🚀 Features
* **User-Friendly Input:** Simple command-line interface for easy data entry.
* **Error Handling:** Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., Rank cannot be greater than Total Candidates).
* **Precision:** accurately calculates percentile to distinguish between close ranks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** [Python 3.9 / C++ / Java]
* **IDE Used:** [VS Code / PyCharm / Eclipse]

## 📝 Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `main.[extension]` file.
3. Enter the requested data when prompted.
